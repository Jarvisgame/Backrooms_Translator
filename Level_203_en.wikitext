==Description==
[[File:Stable walls 1.png|thumb|A photo of Level 203 in the most common area of the Level. Photographer assumed dead.]]'''Level 203''' resembles a large horse stable. The walls within '''Level 203''' can vary depending on where in the Level one is however at all points it will resemble a stable house. The most common appearance in the level is hallways with wood gated stables lining both sides of the walls approximately every 1.3 meters apart from each other. At some points, the stables will begin to be large concrete rooms with white paint covering the whole of the wall. In these areas, large rectangular holes can be found on the walls in random positions with no discernible pattern.

The floor is made up of a dirt-like substance and is often covered in hay. The hay is edible however unrecommended as traces of horse feces have been found within the hay. The level will constantly have the smell of "horses and livestock". The level is poorly lit however there is light present at all times from weak ceiling lights that are found across the whole level.

===Stallions===



Stallions are an entity exclusive to '''Level 203''', Stallions are visibly identical to Horses. Specifically the American Standardbred horse breed. Stallions maintain not only a similar appearance but also similar attributes in strength and speed. Stallions are incredibly aggressive and will attack any wanderer on sight. Along with this, they are incredibly common throughout any area of the level. Stallions look to be decaying on the outside and possess rows of sharp teeth that will inject venom into its victim upon being captured. This venom will begin to morph a wanderer into a biological copy of an American Standardbred that after 4 hours will begin to decay-causing great distress to the victim. Afterwards, they will have become a Stallion in every way.

==Exploration Log 1==



3 agents were sent into '''Level 203''' via The Hub. These agents will be referred to as, Agent 1, Agent 2, and Agent 3.

The 3 agents arrived in '''Level 203''' all equipped with mental assistance pills, a Colt 1911 handgun, and 3 sticks of dynamite. The agents began to start walking around the level and maintained vigilance throughout the entire time. All agents reported feeling uneasy as if they were being watched. This was brushed off as this is a common occurrence across many levels. However, as the agents maintained their path they stumbled upon a brownish-tinted area that looks to be made of concrete. All 3 agents remarked on how much skinnier the halls became as they passed through the area. As they were in this region they stumbled upon a smiler. Standard procedure was carried out however the entity became aggressive and managed to get ahold of Agent 2, killing him. Agent 3 and Agent 1 continued on until they returned to an area that resembled the standard and common area of the level. After 6 hours within the level, they began to hear a clopping noise coming from the distance. This got louder until they heard a loud roar. The roar sounded like a horse's neigh except for deeper and groggy. As they turned the corner, an unknown entity now known as Stallions, was seen charging at them down the hall. The Stallion stomped Agent 1 to death and managed to get ahold of Agent 3 turning him into a Stallion for the camera to record.
