{{Class 1}}[[File:Woodwork.jpg|border|thumb|317x317px|An image of a workshop in '''Level 122'''.|alt=]]
==Description==
'''Level 122''' consists of an extensive system of workshops, storage closets, hallways, and large outdoor areas with thousands of wood chippers. The interior architecture of this level consists of a dark wood and brick design. The workshops are medium sized with a lot of tables, boxes, axes and circular saws. They tend to be dark, but they have some lamps.  The boxes contain tons of wood that can be shredded in wood chippers. Things like almond water, strange chocolate bars, fresh produce, and lots of other foods can be purchased at vending machines with the levels currency, <u>''Wooders''</u>. This level is one of the levels with the most access  to food.[[File:Istockphoto-174901482-612x612.jpg|thumb|181x181px|A hallway in this level.|alt=]]
The outside areas with the wood chippers are extremely dark, and it is impossible to see without a flashlight. Luckily, flashlights can be found in workshops and sometimes under vending machines. Flashlights found under vending machines tend to not work as good and they sometimes flicker, due to an entity called the Flicker.

===<big>122 Inc.</big>===

==== Jake and Kyle ====
Jake and Kyle were spouses who both accidentally tripped into the Backrooms. They got to level 112 by going no-clipping through level 0. They decided to start redecorating the place and making it a sort of retreat for people who stumbled in there, they even sent some staff to go around spreading the news about the level and how homey they made it. Between Jake's cooking and sewing skills and Kyle's woodworking skills, they were able to make level 122 a nicer place for people who gave up on escaping, or were looking for a quick rest.

==Entities==
It's not very common to bump into an entity here, but it's still possible. If entities are coming at you from both ways you might as well give up.

This level contains [[Smilers]], [[Death Moths]], Flickers, and Nippers.

===Flickers===
Flickers are slug like creatures that hide in dark places (like under vending machines). They don't directly attack you, but they do make all light sources around them start to flash on and off and make buzzing noises. Listening to these noises for too long can drive you insane so kill them as fast as you can.

===Nippers===
Nippers are these weird fluffy creatures with long nails and long bodies, filled with what seems to be the stuffing of a teddy bear. They're about the size of a bulldog, and they hang out in groups of anywhere from 3 to 8. They attack you by climbing up you and scratching you with their nails until you bleed out or die from the damage. They can be found in the outside areas hiding inside wood chippers waiting to take you by surprise, or roaming around hallways. Their skin is super soft and thin sort of like a silk, perfect for making pillows and clothing.

==Entrances and Exits==

=== Entrances ===

*Noclipping through walls in [[Level 0]] with torn wallpaper, revealing dark wood paneling;

*Entering a wooden door in [[Level 5]];

*Going to sleep inside a box.
*

==== Exits ====

*Enter into a Perfume Store. [[Rose Water]] may be found inside. It is a substance that looks like liquid pain but smells like roses. Drinking one will make one lose consciousness and they will wake up in [[Level 83]]

*Noclipping through walls that are missing paneling will take you back to [[Level 0]].

* Entering a hatch will instantly lead you to [[Level 889]].
