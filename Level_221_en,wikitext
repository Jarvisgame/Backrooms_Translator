'''Level 2020''' consists of a large neighborhood of two-story houses, some serving as spawn locations. All of the houses in the neighborhood appear newly built. When one spawns in this level, they will find oneself inside one of the houses, alone, as there is a different copy of this level for each person who enters. Most houses are equipped with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, plenty of [[Almond Water]] and food in the kitchen, and a large stock of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in the bathroom.  There is working electricity and water, but no electronic devices such as TVs work here. This level has no day and night cycle, as the time is always noon and the temperature is kept at a comfortable 20'''°'''C (68'''°'''F). Your sanity is much lower than normal in this level, and as time passes it will begin to drop, so it's crucial for you to regularly drink [[Almond Water]]. When your sanity begins to drop, you'll have a massive urge to go outside. '''Do not, under any circumstances, go outside in this level.''' If the urge gets the better of you, and you do go outside, unknown to one, you will be infected with an infectious disease spread through contact by entities called Familiarities. These entities will greet you outside and be friendly to you, while the virus enters your body and slowly kills you.  

If one stays in this level for two weeks and has not been infected with [[Entity List|The Virus]], a door will emerge from the back of the house and one will be sent to another level. However, if you wait for an entire year, a new door will appear. Entering this door will lead you back to [[The Frontrooms]] at the same place and time you entered the Backrooms. However, it's nearly impossible to wait for a year in this level, as one will probably run out of supplies before the 4 month milestone due to the amount of Almond Water that needs to be consumed to stay sane. 

There ''is''  a method for surviving long enough, but is it is highly unrecommended to do it. If you manage to catch a Familiarity without catching the virus (wearing a full protective suit, which can't be found anywhere in this level), wait for 5 days, and then cook the Familiarity and eat its flesh, you may solve the food issue. However, you will still need a lot of Almond Water for staying sane and hydration, which if you bring enough into the level and ration it, is feasible. The reason why this method is unreccomended is because eating Familiarity flesh (which has the same nutritional properties as human flesh) will probably transmit several parasites and diseases, even if you manage not to get The Virus in all this time, and get to The Frontrooms, you will most likely die a few years later due to the meat.

==Entities==

===The Familiarities===
The Familiarities look like people who you recognize. All of these entities are infected with The Virus, but they don't feel the effects of it. It can be people you know well or just a random person on the street you've seen before. These people have the same personalities as they do in [[The Frontrooms]] and talk to you the same, and even recognize you themselves if they know you. These entities will be outside at all times in this level. They do recreational activities, such as biking or playing outdoor games. They don't need to eat anything to stay alive, and they never get tired. They cannot open doors to get to you inside. You will feel a strong pull to one of these entities when your sanity begins to drop, making you want to go outside. As said earlier, do not do this.

If you can't resist the urge, however, and do go outside, these entities will begin to swarm you, asking if you'd like to play with them. By now its too late and you would be infected with The Virus. Playing with these entities will make you feel happy and give you a weird sense of nostalgia, like you've done something like it before.

A scientist wearing a protective suit once lured one into the spawn house and then cut it open. No organs were inside of it, only flesh and bones, so it's unknown how these entities live.

===The Virus of Level 2020===
The Virus is the reason why this level is so dangerous. The Virus is infected in all The Familiarities but doesn't affect them. The Virus spreads by simply being within a clear six feet of an entity that's infected, even only for a split second, unless if such entity is dead. If there is something between The Virus and the entity, it can't infect it. Once the entity is infected, nothing will happens for the first three days. On the fourth day, the entity will begin to have trouble breathing and some parts of the skin may turn purple. On the fifth day, your lungs will shut down,  causing you to die. There's no known cure to this, although [[Super Almond Water]] is speculated to cure it, but it's not known for sure (basically its a Mutated, Fatal Conoravirus who can infect a person even if they wear a face mask).

One time a scientist managed to wear a protective suit and get a sample of this entity without getting it themselves. They took it back out of the level, and they thought it would die, but it still lived. They brought it to a M.E.G. lab and tested it on a captured [[Insanity]], and it died in five days, showing that The Virus is still powerful outside of this level. They threw the test tube out into [[The Void]] so it wouldn't be an issue. Because of this, M.E.G. warns that you definitely shouldn't capture a sample of this to bring back, as it could spread and devastate all of the Backrooms.
