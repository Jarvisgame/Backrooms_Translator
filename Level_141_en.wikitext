[[File:Floodedlibrary.jpg|frame|The first image of level 141]]
'''Level 141''' appears to be an old library flooded with dirty water, the ceiling is white with lights relatively close to each other. Most of the books in this level are partially damaged, most likely due to entities. Very rarely, one way come across a diary made by past backrooms travellers. Under the water, there are trapdoors which lead to other areas of the level, or other levels that are similar to the level, like [[Level 37]]. Occasionally, lights may turn off, before turning on in about 1 minute.

The trapdoors are most likely to bring you to the lower area of the level, The basement, the basement is seemingly infinite, and is home to most of the entities in this level. There are doors in the basement which lead to other levels or the higher areas of the library. In the basement you may find tables that have random objects on them, most likely to be lamps, old phones, magazines and piles of books. Less often, plants, balloons, computers, expired gift cards and objects like [[Liquid Pain]] and [[Almond Water]].             

The upper area, the restaurant is accessed by walking up the stairs and has only 2 entities. This room is very spaced out with tables, vending machines, a food counter and more book shelves. The restaurant has a green carpet floor, white walls, windows and is the only area in '''level 141''' that isn't old and dirty. There is an old elevator in the restaurant that can bring you to other areas in '''level 141.'''
