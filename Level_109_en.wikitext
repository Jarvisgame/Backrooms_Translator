[[File:Level 109.png|thumb|(due to copyright reasons i must say this image comes from russian DALL-E) A image of Level 109]]
==Description==
'''Level 109''' is a cube-shaped level. It is a 1000x1000x1000 square mile, fake reality with 2 farmhouses. Both Farmhouses have a wheat field with more or less than 20 rabbits. These rabbits are, in fact, real. It is said that whenever a rabbit noclips into the backrooms, they are sent to one of the wheat fields here. However, this is unlikely, because when the rabbits are farmed for meat, a new rabbit spawns in that wheat field.    

This level has a L-Shaped Hill which cannot be climbed. There are rumors that attempting to climb the L-shaped hill will make you noclip into a Sublevel of '''Level 109''' when you wont be noticed. However this cannot be confirmed as far as we know.    

There are no Entities in this level. However, as said, there are rabbits in this level, specifically in the wheat fields. People have claimed to have seen smilers in the forests, so it is advised not to enter the forest.

=== The 2 Farmhouses ===

==== Farmhouse 1 ====
This farmhouse has a full chest of Almond Water that restocks itself. The Almond Water is reportedly safe to consume.

This farmhouse also has a furnace, Even though this farmhouse is made of wood. The furnace still doesn't burn the farmhouse down, As it is always On.

==== <big>Farmhouse 2</big> ====
This farmhouse also has a full chest of Almond Water which is safe to consume that restocks itself. This farmhouse also has a constantly overheating Chromebook-like Computer. The OS the Computer is using is unclear, But it is similar to ChromeOS and WIndows 98.

This farmhouse also has a Campfire outside which never goes out.

===== The Computer in the Second Farmhouse =====
This computer does not have a BIOS or troubleshooting mechanisms. But it somehow fixes itself whenever it breaks (However this process can take from 12 hours to 2 months).

This computer can actually send communications to [[The Frontrooms]], However these radio signals can only end up at the earths core or underground, These communications Only last 1 minute anyways.

== <small>The Forest</small> ==
{{Class 3|safety=Unsafe|security=Unsecure|entity=Rumored Entities}}
The forest is Undocumented and can Lead to many Sublevels of Level 109.

The forest has many pits which either lead to sublevels 109.1 and 109.2 or are just endless.

Some pits are Special, However

=== <big>Special pits in the Forest</big> ===

==== Tube Pits ====
Some pits (Specifically 18 pits) are shaped like tubes which go around, These tubes are like roads but Whenever multiple people are in a Tube System, They will always go on separate Paths, Even if this means creating new paths or closing off paths.  Sometimes even making people go backwards 

These pits can lead to these Sublevels:

* 109;05
* 109.1
* 109.15
* 109.2
* 109.3
* 109.5
* 109.9
* 109.99

==== Hidden tunnels ====
Hidden Tunnels can be found underground by digging. These are undocumented, But this is all the info we have about them:

The original point these tunnels are digged to is always where it starts. Where there is a curve where it then goes horizontal.

They seem to be on a hexagonal grid and are very narrow, But whoever digs to them can just fit in it and somehow move through it fast.

some of these tunnels also have holes you will fall into. otherwise whoever goes in the tunnel you keep going infinitely unless they run into a Tube pit.

Holes in these tunnels lead to these sublevels:

* 109.01
* 109.02
* 109.025
* 109.03
* 109.04
* 109.25
* 109.4
* 109.49
* 109.@ (Very Rare)
