{{Class 2e}}

It's like you've been here decades ago, maybe on a trip to your grandpa's old house?

'''Level 214''' is the 215<sup>th</sup> level of the Backrooms.

== Description ==
[[File:214 Main.png|border|thumb|256x256px|Photo of Level 214, photographer reported to have survived this level; their current status is unknown.]]
'''Level 214''' or '''"Old Man's Plains"''' is a indescribably large field of wheat, grass and other wild plants and weeds found in a standard plot of land. Forests usually surround the plains that stretch for no more than a few kilometers at most, the landscape more or less resembles plains from a middle-western state of the US like Ohio or Pennsylvania. The level follows a day-night cycle that is identical to that of the [[The Frontrooms]]. The sky in this level has perfect white clouds that never once move, neither does it rain at all, wanderers use these clouds in order to know where they have been or where they are headed; it is highly unrecommended to stare at the sky for too long however, some reports have detailed that staring at it for too long causes at least, temporary eye damage, and at most, memory loss after around 5 minutes. These effects only occur on direct eye contact, so looking at clouds with your peripheral vision is what's recommended to travelers. The Wheat in these plains can be harvested for food and resources, as well as some small ponds; these ponds have no known lifeforms to inhabit it.

When at night, Level 214 stays exactly the same, except for the fact that owl noises and cricket tunes are heard in the distance despite no life being present other than the grass. When the noises are tracked, the origins come from the ground, trying to dig up the source of the noises only make them stop instantaneously when tampering with the ground. During the night, as well as strange noises, there are odd reports of objects going missing, people going mad, and harm being caused unexplainably. Travelers believe that this occurs due to Moonlight, or light from the Moon; to counter this, travelers have began to wear coats, gloves, scarfs, and hats in order to cover their body. These methods have worked without a problem, and without it, or methods similar, you may be severely scarred from the level upon exiting. Reports of this "Moonlight Madness" say that it causes at minimum: Drowsiness, Hallucinations, Headaches, etc., at maximum, some travelers have reported to have experienced Sharp Pains in the Skull, Nausea, Temporary Psychosis, etc. The Moon in this level is identical to the one in the [[The Frontrooms]], causing some travelers to look at it in awe, then regretting it a few minutes later. This so called Moonlight Madness only requires around 5 minutes of full exposure to start, and around 20-30 minutes to worsen to the maximum; there are no reports of fatalities however, only major side-effects. Upon entering this level it is highly suggested to cover yourself if you know that this is the level you are about to enter; if when entering the level is in its day-cycle, then you can resume to travel as normal, if the level is in its night-cycle, remain covered until it turns to day, or when shelter is found. Houses and Cabins may be found rarely and are useful locations to either settle or hide in during night.


That is not the only hazard to be cautious of, every few weeks there is a certain event that some travelers refer to as either '''"Extinction"''', '''"Old Man's Wrath"''', or '''"Solemn Weather"'''. This causes the landscape to visually melt, decay, transform, and shift into an amalgam of earth and wood. When trying to take a photo of it, it appears as if nothing out of the ordinary is occurring despite the complete opposite happening; the only way to demonstrate what is occurring is to use a camera lens made of Meteoric Glass.

Hide. It will be over soon.

During the '''"Old Man's Wrath"''', large chasms and amalgamations of land break open from the ground; Moonlight Madness occurs during this, only stronger than ever, the only way to protect against it is to cover yourself with either multiple layers of hoodies, jackets, etc. or with a hazmat suit. This event is incredibly dangerous and if not careful can lead to death, most deaths occur when one falls into a chasm or is consumed by Moonlight Madness entirely. Total Madness can only occur during the "'''Old Man's Wrath"''', but if it can occur during the night, no one is brave enough to report the amount of exposure needed to be struck with Total Madness. 

If you ever find yourself in this event, your best option is to RUN from any chasm or any place that looks corrupted.


Failing to remain careful of any dangers can cause the '''"Old Man's Wrath"'''  to follow you.


Run.


RUN.


IT'S BEHIND YOU, RUN.

== Entities ==

[[File:214 Oak Manor.png|thumb|256x256px|Photo of the Oak Manor, after taken, a man exited the house and yelled at the photographer.]]

=== Oak Manor ===

* Large mansion of which 30 people live in.
* Willing to trade items such as [[Almond Water]] in return for labor/gathering wheat.
* During the night or the '''"Old Man's Wrath"''', the inhabitants disappear.
* There is a leader that organizes the people's jobs for the day, almost like the head of a family. 




== Entrances and Exits ==

=== Entrances ===

* Sleep in a patch of wheat in [[Level 10]].
* Meditating for a long time in [[Level 72]] has a low chance of drifting you in a peaceful area of '''Level 214'''.

=== Exits ===

* Managing to fall asleep during the '''"Old Man's Wrath"''' will transport you to [[Level 226]]
* Finding a golden watch inside of a pond will transport you to either [[Level 7]] or [[Level 100]], the watch you find is unbreakable.
* Dying on this level has a small chance to lead you to [[Level 161]], this has only happened to people who haven't killed a single human being.
