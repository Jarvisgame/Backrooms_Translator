==<big>Level 207: A Global Interment</big>==
[[File:Pexels-pixabay-1609321.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum]]
Level 207 is a complete collection of every current burial site from the front rooms. The land area is about 54,500sqkm and consists of cemeteries, graveyards, mausoleums, crematoriums with columbarium walls, and catacombs. Beyond this expanse is ocean. Each section of level 207 has a known counterpart from the backrooms. ''Some'' examples of these burial sites are Xoxocotlan in Oaxaca, Mexico, PÃ¨re Lachaise in Paris, France, Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo, Japan, Waverley Cemetery in Sydney, Australia, Catacombs of Kom al Shoqafa in Alexandira, Egypt, and the Catacombs of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. Each burial site seamlessly connects to each other and will reflect the current weather and temperature of the current site from the frontrooms.

Every monument, though identical in shape and size, will not contain the names of any person or even reference the person the stone or monument was intended for. The wording on these stones instead will reference a level in the backrooms. This reference can be a word or phrase that relates to a certain level, they can also simply have a backrooms level number. These clues will usually be vague and be personal to the knowledge of the wanderer. The markings on these stones will be different for each person looking at them. If two people are looking at the same stone at the same time, the words will appear different, per individual. 

These markings will also change from time to time for each person. A wanderer could be  looking at a monument in the cemetery from New Orleans and the the marking will read "Ripples with no Source". That wanderer may then venture to a nearby cemetery and return to "New Orleans" only to find their previous stone now reads "Raindrops and Red Pages".

There is a method to the orientation of this level. Similar regions connect together. As an example, burial sites from India will be next to other sites from India. Common landmarks from these burial sites will also appear in The Global Interment. Lakes, ponds streams and rivers flow with almond water. Mountains will be the same height. If these sites have a church, so will level 207. Catacombs will usually have an entrance inside a church or in the middle of another known cemetery. These will not take any space above ground in addition to their entrance. Trees and flowers will also be present corelating with the frontrooms. 

Often, organized burial sites such as cemeteries and graveyards will have toolsheds, admin offices, and churches. These buildings will usually be empty with the exception of paper record books and a few tools. Shovels will always be found in utility buildings and record books always appear blank. Rarely coffee or snacks can be found in an admin office as well as a rare bottle of wine in some churches. 

'''The Mourning Effect:''' Some wanderers that have been in the backrooms for a long time are missed by their loved ones from the front rooms. Many presume their wanderer to be deceased. For those wanderers it is speculated that they have their own monuments in the frontrooms. As they find the burial site close to their former home, wanderers will find a monument that fills their mind with sadness, like the feeling of mourning or great loss. These stones will usually have comforting words written on them such as "You Were Loved" or "You May Rest". As the monuments do not have any information on to who may be laid to rest, it is only speculated to be that, belonging to the wanderer.

'''Crematoriums:''' These buildings have complete facilities including full functioning furnaces for cremation. Crematoriums will often have  columbarium walls containing urns. These urns are always filled with ashes. Placing one's hand into the ashes of one of these urns will initiate the '''''weaving projection event''''' for the wanderer. If a wanderer chooses to enter a furnace (including furnaces not yet active) the door of the furnace ''will'' close behind the wanderer and the furnace ''will'' activate.   

'''Furnace Activation:''' ''<u>This event is graphic in nature, readers be advised.</u>'' Upon entering a furnace, the door closes and the furnace activates. A fire ignites and grows. Fire consumes the victim and burns them alive with intense heat. The victim remains conscious during this event as they feel the intense burn of the entire cremation process. The cremation process lasts about 4.5 hours and temperatures will reach about 1000C. During this process, the wanderer's body breaks down in to carbonic ash. Once the wanderer is fully cremated, they will continue to retain their consciousness. They will then be transported to level 207's sub [[level 207.1]].  
[[File:Pexels-henry-&-co-7147037.jpg|thumb|Columbarium ]]
'''The Weaving Projection Event:''' This event is triggered when a wanderer places their hands in the ashes of an urn. The wanderer enters into a trance state and their conscience enters this level's sub [[level 207.1]]. Here the wanderer floats in the air of [[level 207.1]] and are unable to move their bodies except their hands. The wanderer can, however, see and hear. It is possible that the wanderer might hear the voices of ''The Dusted'' or see their glowing particles. This will not always happen. If this does happen a wanderer may choose to move their hands around these particles in a motion as though they are weaving. Doing so will collect the particles into a single mass and will begin to take the shape of a human. This motion must be continuous for an uncertain amount of time as the particles will try to dissipate as you collect them. If you can complete the weaving, the humanoid shaped mass will flash in a burst of light and then vanish. Wanderers have noted to experience a strong rush of endorphins causing a full euphoric release.  
==<big>Notable Locations</big>== 

Aside from The Global Interment being home to every burial site in the frontrooms, there are a few surprising, notable locations that might seems anomalist or at the very least, a point of interest. 

* '''The Great Pyramids:''' These are technically monuments for the dead and act as such. The architecture and design are identical to the pyramids from the front rooms, though the insides are known to have entities consistently present. It is advised to take caution when entering the pyramids.
*'''Neptune Memorial Reef:''' A cemetery found 12m underwater in the ocean off the western coast of level 207. Each monument is reminiscent of marine life found in the frontrooms and are artistically oriented to look like the lost city of Atlantis.
*'''The Great Wall of China:''' Straight through the middle of the Chinese burial sites runs this giant wall. It seems to serve no purpose other than to be a barrier.
*'''Mount Crni Vrh:''' A mountain found in the middle of the European section of level 207. It doesn't have any monuments and seems to be a normal mountain.
* '''The Fields of Verdun:''' Also situated in the European section of level 207 houses a single, large monument. This area is home to many shadow walkers and scratchers.
* '''Open Fields:''' Seemingly uncharacteristic of The Global Interment, there is about 10,000sqkm of open fields or groves found, scattered throughout the level.

Though there are dangers present in The Global Interment, many wanderers find enjoyment from site seeing and experiencing the spooky and peaceful sites present in level 207. 

==<big>Entities</big>== 

*'''[[Shadow Walkers|Shadow Walkers:]]''' These entities usually appear during night time or in catacombs. Some can be hostile and tend to be attracted towards exhausted and sleepy wanderers. They are found throughout the entire level but most notably in the Fields of Verdun.
*'''Shadow Nightmares''': These entities are solid black figures that seems to appear and disappear out of the corner of your eyes. They have a special effect that will lower the sanity of a wanderer. They will not attack a wanderer until their sanity drops to abysmal levels. They behave similar to the nightmares in found in the anomaly: [[Terror Dreams]]. These entities exist in particularly old cemeteries, mausoleums, and catacombs. They are uncommon but dangerous. If you suspect the presences of these entities, leave the area immediately. Drinking almond water will relieve the effects caused by shadow nightmares.
*'''[[Smilers]]:''' These entities are found in old, dark churches or in the catacombs. They can also be found in The Great Pyramids.
* '''[[Hound|Hounds:]]''' Can be found in any part or time in level 207.
*'''[[Death Moths|Death Moths:]]''' Both Male and female death moths can be found above ground. They will usually gather near lamps during night time.
* '''[[Scratcher|Scratchers]]:''' These entities are not very common in level 207 but have been spotted, most notably in The Fields of Verdun.
* '''[[Windows]]''': These entities can sometimes be found in old churches or rarely in admin buildings. <br /> 

==<big>Outposts and Colonies</big>==

*'''The Knitting Club:''' This is a small group of wanderers of about 10 or so that live in a large crematorium in the Tokyo area. They spend their time in projection weaving. They are addicted to the high they receive when completing a full weave. They are friendly to travelers and will offer to instruct the wanderer on good weaving techniques. They claim to have a few outposts scattered about in order to assist wanderers in learning how to properly weave.
*'''The Cult of the Pharaohs:'''  Due to the artwork and statues that can be found inside the pyramids, The Cult of the Pharaohs live and hold ceremonies inside and on top of the pyramids as a form of worship to these "gods". This group is not friendly to wanderers and will sometimes attempt to sacrifice wanderers to their gods.
*'''The Catacomb Raiders:''' This is an explorer group that searches this level's many catacombs and mausoleums for treasures and weapons. They are friendly to wanderers but wish to keep any found treasures. However, they ''will'' gift a treasure to a friendly enough wanderer.
*'''M.E.G. Outpost Delta-1-Echo:''' Established in 2020 out of a large admin building in the England section. This outpost stations about 8 operators. Their goal is to explore and study Shadow Walkers and Shadow Nightmares due to their rarity. They are known to guide wanderers to other levels or provide basic maps of level 207. <br />
==<big>Entrances</big>==  

All entrances in level 207 will spawn you inside of a coffin. If you are lucky, this coffin will exist in an open space such as a catacombs area or an above ground cemetery. If you are unlucky, you will have to dig yourself out of the ground after bursting the coffin you are in. If attempting to enter this level, it is advised to bring some tools, notably a shovel.  

*Digging deep into [[level 83]] and finding, opening, and entering a coffin will lead you to level 207.
* Walking into a random house in [[level 10]] has a small chance to spawn a coffin at the front door. As you attempt to exit the house, you will open the door to face the coffin. It will feel as something mysteriously pulls you into the coffin space. The door behind slams shut and you are transported to level 207.
*Attempted self burial in [[level 95]] will lead you to level 207.
*Entering and closing a sarcophagus from [[level 128]] has a small chance of transporting you inside The Great Pyramids in level 207.
*<s>Laying down inside a baptismal font from [[level 409]] has a small chance to spawn you in a graveyard near a church in level 207.</s>
* Laying down inside a baptismal font from [[level 1098]] has a small chance to spawn you in a graveyard near a church in level 207.
*<s>Crawling inside a coffin in the large cemetery of Hemsworth City in [[level 1738]] will spawn you into a coffin from the Olongapo City, Philippines cemetery section in level 207</s>.
* Noclipping through a crack in [[level -99]] will bring you to a coffin in a catacombs section in level 207.
*Approaching the warm embrace of a spectral hand in [[level 207.1]] until healed will lead you back to level 207.

'''Oxygenating Moss:'''  Determined to actually be a mold, this growth lines each of the coffins wanderers spawn in. They seem to produce hydrogen peroxide as a gaseous byproduct. This mold will also produce an unknown catalystic chemical compound that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water vapor and elemental oxygen. This is a very quick and efficient process. Wanderers note the feint smell of hydrogen peroxide but do not experience any toxic side effects. It is possible for wanderers to stay in these coffins for extended periods of time without the risk of suffocation. 
==<big>Exits</big>== 

''Every single monument in this level presents a path to any level in the backrooms''. A wanderer will find clues such as vague phrases or even numbers carved onto the monuments of this level. In order to travel to another level, a wanderer must open the grave site and enter a coffin. Once the wanderer closes the lid, they will be transported its corresponding level. As of now, this is the only known method of leaving level 207 but again, note that a wanderer can be led to any level. ''If the coffin does not have a monument, the wanderer will not be transported to another level.'' It must have some sort of marking with words carved into it. If a wanderer enters a furnace inside a crematorium, they will be transported to the sub [[level 207.1]]. This is agonizing and ill advised.
