'''Level 234''' is the 235<sup>th</sup> level of The Backrooms.

{{Class 2}}

[[File:Level 234 map.jpg|thumb|Representation of the '''Level 234''' territory. Purple is Caraguaçu, Red is Santa Cecília das Rochas, Yellow is Beco da Baiúca, and Green is Porto dos Milagres.]]

==Description==
'''Level 234''' is known to be a pretty safe level. However, there are some reports that indicate that skin-stealers may be present in this level. It resembles a normal Brazilian city, but bigger than the average one. Due to the nature of the level, a lot of explorers stay here to live and create colonies. Compared to other levels, 234 is pretty unique, since some elements of this level are based on real life, specifically the culture of the different regions of Brazil. This level is also one of the most populated in The Backrooms, also being one of the biggest non-infinite levels.[[File:Level 234 church.jpg|thumb|'''Level 234''' church. It seems to be constructed around 1890.|alt=|210x210px]]

There are a lot of favelas present in this level, although most of the houses there are abandoned, and you can find some resources inside of them. There is also a church on top of a mountain. To go there, you can go by the stairs that have 382 steps, or you can go by the 3 sets of the funiculars. 

The basilic is pretty big, but no one lives there. People occasionally go there to keep contact with their religion, respecting others. There is also an stadium present in this level. It is very similar to Maracanã, but it is partially abandoned, some people lived there in the past, when the structure wasn't so bad. The grass is yellow, the seats are broken and the structure is damaged. The houses present in '''Level 234''' are similar. There are a lot of religious images inside, and the floors outside the houses are made of red, orange and yellow tiles. Inside, it is very cozy. If it is owned by an old person, you can see a lot of crochet present in the furniture.

Certain houses may have a sign on them, those houses will be infinite, sometimes leading to a completely different back rooms level after exiting.

Eventually, you can find a lot of stores, bars, gyms, courts, restaurants, etc. It appears that some people in this level in the past played a lot of sports to maintain their sanity on healthy levels, since there are a lot of courts built recently. We don't know how they got basketballs or footballs to play, but they are present on some places in this level. The bars are quite padronized, always being sponsored by beer companies present in the [[The Frontrooms|Frontrooms]]. However, they are the most active place through the level, and they are open most of the times.

On certain areas of this level, there is a beautiful demonstration of flora and fauna, with diverse plants in general and local animals. Some habitants theorize that some entities that have appeared on this level originate around the forests. In this level, although it's highly urbanized and developed, they don't have a monetary system like the countries in the Frontrooms does. Instead, they all help each other with no money involved. One factor that helps is that they don't have a central government, but certainly this wouldn't work in the real world.

There are a lot of houses that are available to live in, but if you can't find them, be sure to have a sleeping bag just for your own comfort and safety. Also, keep a weapon with you, because there may be a lot of thieves in this level due to the system of the society already built there. This level also happens to have a lot of supply rooms. The colonies on this level can guide you to there, and some of them are located next to them.This level has a mediocre Wi-Fi connection depending on where you want to access the internet. 

Below, there are listed the 4 divisions and the respective sub-divisions of this level:

<tabber>
|-| Caraguaçu=
Caraguaçu is the biggest division on this level. It's also the only territory that isn't located in the coast. It resides around 30% of the total habitants of this level. The population generally like to say that the division is the capital of '''Level 234'''.

Adventurers love to visit there to interact with the giant buildings. The native population isn't as friendly as the other ones, but they're relatively enjoyable. During the process of development of the division, a lot of schools were built; that helped a lot after, as a lot of children were born while their moms were exploring the Backrooms.

There are a lot of shopping centers, restaurants, police stations, hospitals, etc. It also resides most of the macro and micro colonies on this level. It resides the colonies of The Big Family and Tribo Guarani. Not only that, but it isn't likely that you'll find a lot of entities there, as most of them were killed by some of the powerful organizations that reside there.

The events of The Lead Masks and The Haunted Museums also happened/happens there. People tend to live here rather than the other regions because most of the entrances lead here, it has most of the population, and it is the most evoluted area. [[File:Caraguaçu flag.png|thumb|Caraguaçu flag. (Made by [[User:OGominho|OGominho]])]]

====Favela do Sol====
Sun Slum — roughly translated to English — is a region located in Caraguaçu composed of weak-built houses. Most of the people living there sadly couldn't live in better places in Level 234 due to overpopulation. People often die there because of the lack of the sanitation services, and some clothed facelings live there, isolating from the rest of the population. Surprisingly, there was the only part where people accepted these entities to live with them as a society.

Powerful organizations, — such as the Backrooms Colonists and the M.E.G. — have already tried to help them to get a better place to live, but unfortunately the project didn't go well, as the exits that they leaded people to didn't have proper living conditions. Because of that, a big part of the explorers protested against the organizations, causing them to have a very big rejection percentage.

====Betaville====
Betaville is a gated community present in Caraguaçu, characterized by modern buildings. The so called upper-middle class lives here, although there isn't a monetary system present in Level 234. The habitants of this region are really prejudiced against people that don't live there. For that reason, they are one of the most hated groups in this level.

The buildings there were designed by top-tier engineers and architects present inside the Backrooms, brought by the M.E.G. from other levels to '''Level 234'''. Some high-end industries can also be found there, but some of them were abandoned a long time ago.
|-|Santa Cecília das Rochas=

Santa Cecília das Rochas is one of the three territories located in the coast, and part of the territory is located on an island. You can go there by a massive bridge constructed by the habitants of '''Level 234'''. It resides 15% of the people that live there. Although it isn't as civilized as Caraguaçu, the society there is way more peaceful, as there are fewer people to control. 

The houses there are very close together, and most of the population there is into catching fish and harvesting seafood, their main source of food. The division could be described as a very big fishing village. Some very interesting caves can be found there, and the population likes to adventure through them, trying to see what they can find there.

The “rural” part of the level isn't as densely populated as the coastal area, but people can find habitants living there, mainly relying on the marine entities that come from the coast for sustenance.

Some fishermen are very skilled in terms of boats, selling them to the population for them to fish, but they also care about the environment. In some certain times of the year, they prohibit catching some specific species, and the ones who are caught with them may go to the “prison” of the level as a punishment.

The Republic of Level 153 is located there. The Black Opala history happened there. Wanderers can even find some hotels scattered around the level.[[File:Santa Cecília das Rochas flag.png|thumb|Santa Cecília das Rochas flag. (Made by [[User:OGominho|OGominho.]])]]

=== Saramandaia ===
Saramandaia is one of the beaches present in Santa Cecília das Rochas. A long time ago, residents of Level 234 used this beach to dispose the trash that they generated. As the time passed by, animals and plants didn't survive living there, and Saramandaia turned improper for fishing and swimming. Habitants of Santa Cecília even tried to clean the water with the support of big organizations, but unfortunately, it didn't work. Now, the beach is protected, and only authorized personnel can step there. 

|-|Porto dos Milagres=

Porto dos Milagres isn't really populated, but it is also located in the coast, just like Santa Cecília das Rochas. It is used more as a place to travel to and to return after. People also go fishing there to have something to eat. 

Generally, the appearance of this division is very similar to Santa Cecília das Rochas, but with less fishing and more actual houses. Some hotels can be found here, and they're generally occupied. The waves there are very calm, so explorers really like spending time swimming.

It is a famous touristic location, and the recommendations are widely shared throughout the Backrooms, with some explorers staying there to live. It is one of the places documented by [[Daniel Dumile's Dearest Diary|Daniel Dumile]].

One of the most famous locations in the upper levels of The Backrooms. Some colonies that are there, hiding themselves from the rest of the level are The Red Faction and the Faith Cult. It is one of the regions that you can encounter normal animals present in the Frontrooms, mostly types of fish and crustaceans.[[File:Porto dos Milagres.png|thumb|Porto dos Milagres flag. (Made by [[User:OGominho|OGominho]].)]]

=== Big Beach ===
Big Beach is the most popular beach present in Porto dos Milagres. There, the water is more peaceful than the rest of the territory, so people come to relax and swim instead of fishing. Some other residents loved so much that beach, that they constructed kiosks and houses on the edge of the beach.

Top-tier hotels can also be found there. The beach is separated in two parts; in the first one, the water is very calm, and the kiosks stay there to accommodate the population, while the second part is more visited by surfers, where they like to practice their sport in “peace”.

|-|Beco da Baiúca=

Beco da Baiúca is the second-biggest territory in this level, being also the second most populated division. It resides about 25% of the people that live there, and it is located next to Santa Cecília das Rochas. The population of the level is exponentially growing, and it will eventually surpass Caraguaçu, according to studies made by the [[Backroom Colonists|Backrooms Colonists]].

Part of the level is located on the urban area, and the other part is coastal. The urban part doesn't have a lot of big buildings, being mostly consisted of houses, supermarkets, and some other minor establishments. The rural area doesn't have a lot of people, but recently a migratory flow has started to grow, causing an rural exodus inside Beco da Baiúca. The explorers are still trying to get used to the new lifestyle.

People there live a very healthy lifestyle, and are generally very friendly. You may find a lot of the smaller colonies and/or outposts there, most of them being open for trades and to join them.

Although it is generally a safe level, some streets and avenues may have local hostile entities, and it is advised to be protected against them in case they attack. It also resides the colonies of Caiová Group and The Good Ones. The rock that The Smilers' Head is carved is there too. It is also the territory that happened The Organ Stealer Incident.[[File:Beco da Baiúca.png|thumb|Beco da Baiúca flag. (Made by [[User:OGominho|OGominho]].)|alt=]] 

=== Asa Branca ===
Asa Branca is the urban part of Beco da Baiúca. From the total population of the territory, approximately 70% live here. It isn't as developed as Betaville, but it's still a great place to live. The population is very welcoming, with this sub-division being elected as the most peaceful part of Level 234 (research done by the [[Backroom Colonists]]).

=== Guaraná ===
Guaraná is the coastal part of Beco da Baiúca. It resides the other 30% of this territory. Although this sub-division is peaceful now, it had some violent incidents in the past with the militia and its integrants. People also go there to relax and explore, with some parts being safe for swimming and fishing

==Past Events==
<tabber>
|-|The Haunted Museums=
[[File:Level 234 - 2 (Also CC-BY-SA friendly).jpg|thumb|Representation of Level 234 museums. (Credits to Jonas de Carvalho.)]]
In this level, you can visit a lot of museums that are based on different themes. Some of them even document the distant past of the Backrooms, and what happened before it became so popular. As they are also based on the normal world, a lot of them were palaces to the monarchs that lived here and now their furnitures and curiosities are exhibited to the people that stay on this level. However, a lot of explorers related hearing strange noises while walking around that museums. 

Sounds of someone walking with chains attached to them, glass and ceramic objects breaking, whispers and conversations in the distance. Some others even related loud screams, as if someone was being tortured. We have informations that there are unknown entities that reside inside that palaces, and the ones that misbehave while observing will be haunted while in this level. This can be observed by the notes on the floor, indicating that some people had their sanity highly affected, to the point that even some "goodbye" letters were seen.

|-|The Black Opala=
It was declared that some time ago, a man used to rob other explorers of Level 234 on a black Opala, a car that no one knew how it was working. Apparently, the car didn't have a battery attached, but God knows how, the car was still in perfect condition. He used to stay around a tunnel that connected two of the biggest locations of that level (Caraguaçu and Beco da Beiúca). One day, one of my (<s>now distant</s>(we're close again!) friends was almost robbed. He related:

<code>"I was walking on that tunnel, and I saw that guy with the Opala, he was coming from the main part here. I started running to the opposite direction, because he would need to go reverse to rob me. When he went to my direction, he tried to hit me with the car, but he missed me and instead hit the wall. I'm 100% certain that he died that moment, no one heard about him after this."</code> 

However, less than a month after, some people recognized that same Opala on the street running, but no one was driving it. It appears to have a human-like behavior, the car horn also works. That car appears to go after people that was robbed by that guy while he was alive.

|-|The Lead Masks=
7 months ago, 2 people (1 man and 1 woman) were found together with a letter that they wrote and lead masks. They had already passed away, and their bodies were already starting to decompose. They were known to be very friendly according to the people who interacted with them, and they were discovered by a young man that was trying to find almond water. When he was reading the letter, what was written surprised him: 

"''16:30 in the determined place, 18:30 ingest pill, after effect, protect metals and wait mask signal. the end."''

The meaning is very vague, so he was confused by it. They also were carrying medium quantities of lead with them, and they had some injuries in the head.

|-|The Organ Stealer Incident=
Once upon a time in [[Level 234]], there was a certain man who lived in Beco da Baiúca that wasn't trusted by the population of the level. He didn't have any appearance traits that made him intimidating, but his personality was... hard to deal, to say the least. He had anger issues, alongside with intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and ADHD and he just didn't want to treat it.  

People already suspected that he did some morally wrong things around Beco da Baiúca, but they didn't want to accuse him. In a very dark night, the man was walking around the streets to find his first victim. He found a woman in her thirties, walking back to her home. He offered a bottle of almond water laced with roofie, a highly sedative and hypnotic pill. Unfortunately, she drank it and quickly passed out. He took her to his home, put her on his table and extracted her liver. No one knows why he did that, because there is no type of black market on Level 234. She woke up in a bathtub full of ice, with a big cut on her back. She died due to an infecction, and some time after, her friends realized that she was missing.  

They first suspected of that man. They went to his home to interrogate him, entered his home without his permission and saw the body. The man went insane and started running on the streets, trying to find a random group of facelings for him to end himself. The group of friends started running after him. After 25 minutes of chasing, the man saw a group of isolated facelings. He grasped the faceling shirt (Yes, facelings in this level are clothed, and they are peaceful when clothed.) and ripped it. The entity also got mad and started to attack the man. According to the friends, the group of facelings started to eat him head to toe, and he un-alived himself as he planned to do. 

|-|The Deathmoth Incident=
<font color="red">'''<big><code>(Not 100% confirmed)</code></big>'''</font> Some rumors said that not too long ago, [[Death Moths]] inhabited Level 234 alongside with humans, but due to the fast urbanization of the level, they couldn't build hives, and the proportion male/female of the entity disrupted a mass extinction of them, and you still can find traces of them in the places with more nature, according to "natives". Luckily, it seems that the Moths haven't came back, and it's unlikely that they'll make a return.

|-|The Smilers' Head=
Some residents to this level saw that, on a plateau, it looks like someone or something carved a face on it. The weirdest part is that the smilers' face has around 20 meters from the start of his smile to the end. No one know who or what carved it, and no one could make a plausible explanation. Some explorers observed that they had nausea, vomits, headaches and even internal bleedings in extreme cases while near the face. The origin of this monument is unknown, and it may remain a mystery forever.

</tabber>

==Colonies and Outposts ==
There are a lot of colonies in this level, the main reason is because it has a similar identity to the normal world, so many explorers of The Backrooms stay and live here. Organizations also come here to document the "uncommonness" of '''Level 234'''. These below are the most known of them:

===The Big Family / A Grande Família ===

*There are 10 main members. It had 19 before, but they somehow exited this level.

=== Sao Paulo ===

* Sao Paulo is an group owned by '''Almond Water Inc.''' located in Porto dos Milagres.
*It is mainly composed of portguese speaking people.
*Will always accept new citizens as long they don't turn hostile

== Wars ==
The first recorded war to ever happen in level 234, is called the Sao Paulo war. This war was between Growing builders and São Paulo. Eventually, São Paulo was victorious over Growing Builders. The war lasted about 6 years and 7 months. There were many ca usual ties, about 200. But the war was split up when the other towns, came in and stopped them before the all died.  

==Entities==
There are some entities present in '''Level 234''', including some exclusives to this level. Here are them:

===[https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Entities#Skin-Stealers Skin-Stealers]===
Although skin-stealers are known to be only on Level 1 and 2, on this level, there is a group of pacific skin-stealers, as they're clothed (won't attack humans). Due to the stereotypes, no one tried to get near them, but there isn't a report of a violent action of them.

===[https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Entities#.22Jerry.22 "Jerry"]===
The only specimen of Jerry present in this level is with the Faith Cult. We don't know it's behavior, since the Cult isn't open to contact with humans. Be careful, because this level is also native to normal parrots, not to be confused with Jerry. A good guide to help habitants is that Jerry always has his head tilted to the right (If you see him from the front), while the normal parrots normally have their head straight.

==="Dona Jô"===
Resembles a mid-age woman, and has been confirmed to not have any hostile intentions. Always appears on bars on '''Level 234''' hosted by wanderers, and chats with them, about their life problems and other stuff, then she just disappears out of... thin air?  <code><big>Needs better documentation.</big></code>

=== "Seu Zé"===
He is the counterpart to Dona Jô. A mid-age man, very friendly most of the times. Also always appears on bars on '''Level 234''', but appears more frequently. Chats with everyone, no matter the age, about the same topic as Jô. Most of the times he appears drunk, may present episodes of aggressiveness and are available to help anyone in need.  <code><big>Also needs better documentation.</big></code>

===Cachorrinho Caramelo===
[[File:Cachorrinho Caramelo CC BY SA Friendly.png|thumb|An image of Cachorrinho Caramelo sent by one of the explorers (credits to Lucas Brigido).]]
Another level exclusive entity. Cachorrinho Caramelo appears to be a common medium-sized dog, with a very beautiful caramel-pigment fur and slight floppy ears; very similar to the ones found in [[The Frontrooms]]. It is theorized that this entity was a result of a lot of different breeds.

They can generally be seen wandering around the streets or in front of houses and stores, where they spend their days there. Explorers love to pet and give treats to Cachorrinho, as they're docile and won't pose a threat to anyone unless attacked first.

Some other variations of Caramelo can be found on Level 234, including, but not limited to:

* Smaller breeds, such as Chihuahuas;
*White spots on fur;
*Darker ochre color.

Now talking about this level: This looks a lot like my hometown. I even found my Frontrooms house here! Wow. This reminds me a lot of my childhood. I even found some of my friends that I met early on my journey in the Backrooms.

==Entering Level 234==
If you walk away from the rainforest on [[Level 233]], you will eventually find a city, that turns out to be '''Level 234'''. If you type in "Iguaçu" in computer inside a mansion on [[Level 588]], you will also no-clip to here on a random house. 

If you enter one of the unlocked doors (very rare to happen) on [[Level 54]], you may end up here too. Noclipping through the houses on [[Level 9]] has a 1.5% chance of leading you here.    

If you touch a photo of a city on a tree in [[Level 706]] it has a 99% chance of bringing you here    

==Exiting Level 234==
Try to run away from the city. Eventually, you will find a beautiful beach. However, you have just entered [[Level 100]]. Good luck. If you start to see a lot of big buildings, hospitals, hotels, office buildings and etc., you have just breaked the barrier between '''Level 234''' and [[Level 11]], but be conscient that you will have to walk a lot to exit this level.

One could exit the level by entering a personnel-only door inside a flower store, leading them to [[Level 150]]. If you drink 3 units of expired coconut water, you'll go to [[Level 289]]. These are the only exits as of now, or at least, the only confirmed ones
