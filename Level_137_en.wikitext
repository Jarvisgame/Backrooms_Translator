{{DISPLAYTITLE: Level 137: Spruce Roads}}
[[File:Level 137.jpg|alt=|thumb|An image of Level 11 taken via a photographer from M.E.G. They wish for their name to be kept anonymous.]]


Level 137 looks similar to a long street within a forest of dark spruce trees. The road spans infinitely in length, and is about 48 feet wide, with lines approximately 3-4 feet away from one another going infinitely down the middle. The time is always around 5:45 PM with the sun always behind you, and your shadow stays in front of you at all times for reasons unknown. Sometimes one can find supplies and such, or a lucky penny at times. The level stays at around 45Â° Fahrenheit, but can sometimes drop lower when snow falls onto the level, making the roads icy.  
 
The trees are similar to those you would find in real life, and can be chopped down. The trees will automatically replace themselves after a period of 2-4 hours of unsupervised time. These trees grow things like apples, oranges, coconuts, and more. At times, a tree might fall down, but will never hurt or kill a wanderer within the level. These fruits will never show up on cameras for reasons unknown. 

One can find a vehicle after walking about 20 miles backwards from where they started. The vehicle will always have the properties below: 

* Always near empty on gas but never runs out.
* Always unlocked. 
* Always a truck. 
* Always blue, red, or white. 
* Never need a key to start. 

== Colonies ==
At this moment in time, '''NO COLONIES''' have been discovered as of 2/22/22.

== Entrances and Exits: ==
One can enter randomly after walking or driving along a road for long enough, or via walking in the woods and finding a road.

You can also enter via cutting down enough trees, which will bring one to this level but without any truck spawning.


To exit, just keep driving or walking, after awhile, you will be brought to a level with a road within it.

Or, alternatively, you can walk or drive into the forest for long enough to be brought to a level with trees or a road within it.
