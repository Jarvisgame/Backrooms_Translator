==Description==
===The Desert===
'''Level 139''' is a small suburban neighbourhood within a long and infinitely spanning desert. The deserts' environment contains traits similar to that of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert Mojave Desert]. However, unlike the Mojave Desert, the desert found on '''Level 139''' does not contain many rocky mountains and contains primarily sand with some [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte buttes]. There are no sentient life forms existing in this level; the only life forms to exist are plants.  

An odd phenomenon that exists on this level is the wind. Although no large water source or forest exist on this level, a gust of wind can still be felt. At times, wind chimes can be heard but this can be chalked up to the hallucinogenic symptoms of the desert.   

Like many deserts, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage mirages] can be seen but in the deserts of '''Level 139''', these mirages can be hyper realistic. Mirages in this desert often take the form of a building that holds sentimental value to the explorer. As a result, the explorer may run towards the mirage leading them further into the desert and to their deaths. Oftentimes, mirages are optical phenomenons but since the mirages on '''Level 139''' specifically create buildings which hold sentimental value, it is believed that they are hallucinations of the mind rather than a phenomenon.

====Architecture and Landscape====

Past the road, the desert begins and one of the only two rocky mountains on this level can be seen.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/qii7ca/fake_turf_outside_a_casino_makes_the_desert_look/ u/OliverWDahl]; [http://www.oliverdahl.com/wendover Website]</ref> ]]
Within this infinite desert, there is a small suburban neighbourhood that is well kept but does not possess any individuals. The houses within this neighbourhood are designed in a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Revival_architecture Pueblo Revival style]; also known as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Revival_architecture Santa Fe style]. The neighbourhood also contains grass, roads, fire hydrants, stop signs and trees all of which seem to be well kept and regulated. There is no running water, street lights or electricity on this level which causes nights on this level to be incredibly cold and dark.  

The grass in the suburbia seems to be incredibly maintained much like a golf course. Although no maintenance is ever done or seen, the grass does not grow, change or die off and continues to appear highly maintained.  

There is no litter seen within the suburbia. In the [[frontrooms]], oftentimes suburban neighbourhoods contain garbage disposal bins but within '''Level 139''' there are no visible garbage bins.  

====Interior Designing====

The interior designing of these houses draw inspiration from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-century_modern retro futuristic styles of the 1970s]. Within the houses food does exist but type and amount varies for each house; food is not replenishable ergo, there is a limited amount that can expire. Additionally, some water found on this level seems to be contaminated with the [[Hydrolitis Plague]].  

==Entities==
There are no entities on this level. Other than trees, grass, and some foods, this level is completely devoid of life. No sentient life exists on this level apart from the explorers themselves. 

Although there are no threats on this level, this level is far from safe. The heat from the desert can cause hallucinogenic symptoms. However, that is far from the most dangerous aspect: on many liminal-space levels such as this one, the mind can go unstable in such isolating conditions. 

==Colonies and Outposts ==
There are no colonies and no outposts on this level. 

==Entrance and Exits ==
